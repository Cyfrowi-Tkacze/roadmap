# Roadmap
You will find below a roadmap with recommended free resources.
The roadmap is just a suggestion. It is possible to select one of the paths and progress. 
Although it would be the most beneficial to follow recommended path. 
The roadmap is deep-knowledge focused. You might use existing libraries and tools to build
your own projects without deeper understanding of underlaying mechanism, but we believe that
to be efficient in the field at least understanding of foundations is crucial.

The roadmap below is still in progress. It may change in a course of time.

### Phase 1: Foundational Knowledge
1. Mathematics
Linear Algebra: Vectors, matrices, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors.
Calculus: Derivatives, integrals, partial derivatives, and chain rule.
Probability and Statistics: Probability distributions, Bayesâ€™ theorem, expectation, variance, and hypothesis testing.
2. Programming Skills
Python: Focus on libraries like NumPy, pandas, and matplotlib.
JS/Typescript: Langchain.

### Phase 2: Core Machine Learning Concepts
1. Introduction to ML
Types of ML: Supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.
Basic Algorithms: Linear regression, logistic regression, k-Nearest Neighbors, decision trees.
2. Data Preprocessing
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and data imputation.
Feature Engineering: Feature scaling, encoding categorical variables, and feature selection.
3. Model Evaluation
Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.
Cross-validation: k-fold cross-validation, stratified sampling.

### Phase 3: Advanced Machine Learning Techniques
1. Advanced Algorithms

### Phase 4: Practical Applications and Projects
1. Project Development
Kaggle Competitions: Participate in challenges to apply knowledge.
Personal Projects: Implement end-to-end projects, from data collection to model deployment.
2. Specialized Areas
